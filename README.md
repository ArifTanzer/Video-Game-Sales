# Video-Game-Sales
An analysis of video game sales from a dataset

In this project i wanted to make an analysis project based on a premade dataset 
which can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

I have uploaded my codes from a while back. If ou import the necessary dataset you can 
plot some visuals and determine sales between different labels.
